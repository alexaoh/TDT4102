# Questions to the tasks

1. Range-based for loop for Vector_ref? Don't understand why auto does not give class type? (in function testAnimal())

2. Task 1: Override keyword makes no difference when defining (and calling) the toString() functions in Cat and Dog? Works without the override keyword!?
```
This is correct! The keyword override explicitly declares to the compiler that a function is meant to override another function (a virtual function). This way we can get the compiler to help check that it works as it should.
