# Questions to the tasks

1. "Utskrift av tid": The modulo operator does not work with other than integers. Any suggestions? (I brute forced it, writing the modulo operation manually. This is probably not the best way to solve the problem!) Need guidance when it comes to the function printTime()!

2. What should I use as Pi in calculations? Do I have to define one my self? What is recommended in this course?

3. My randomWithLimits() function does not return the same numbers when i don't specify the seed with srand, as described. Why aren't the numbers different? Somethin wrong? (task 5)

4. I don't think the way to set upper and lower limit in the rand() function makes sense. Why can I use modulo etc to do this? Find out!

# Note on task 5: 

* PPP 24.7 presents randint (a newer and better method for generating random numbers, compared to the method used in this task.)
