# Questions to the tasks

1. Hvordan overlaste [] slik at den fungerer for 2-indeksering? Array[i][j] skal ogs√• fungere!

3. Take a closer look at the way the matrix (table-member) is defined. Really understand how it works!

4. Fix operator[]-overloading in Matrix-class! How can this be written so that i works twice? A[i][j]?
