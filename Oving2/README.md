# Questions to the tasks

1. How can i set precision when returning a double from a function? E.G. in inputDouble(), task 2d). Seems like the precision of the returned double is random. 

> Check Appenix in PPP. **setprecision** and **fixed** are mentioned in the task. Chapters that are mentioned in the task are: B.7.6, 11.2.3 and 11.2.4. 
**Finish task 2 after I have received the book!**

2. More questions in the code --> many may be solved when I receive the book. 

3. Why does the answers in 6 rely on whether I use rate/100, rate\*0.01 or rate*(1/100)?! (E.G in 6b: calculateAnnuity) I would quess it has to do with memory, but I have no clear idea!
