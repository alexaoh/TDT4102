# Questions to the tasks:

1. Are all the return types from the functions correct?
2. Am i supposed to use std::boolalpha in oppgave f) to get the correct return values?
3. Do I have to return something (E.G 0) from the main()?
> The compiler is **smart**, which means that if you don't write a return statement it automatically returns 0.
> However, it is common practice to always have a return statement, in **all** functions (from void; use empty return).
