# Error handling (IO error handling) PPP 10.6
cin is an istream object
Istream maintains a stream state: 
* good()
* eof()
* fail()
* bad()

cin.clear() sets the state to good (good() returns true)
cin.unget() puts last character back to input stream
cin.ignore(n, delim) deletes p to n characters, or until a char-delimiter

# Error handling PPP 5
PPP 5.6.3 - Bad input
Our programs should (what is expected of us in this course): 
1. Produce the desired result for all illegal inputs
2. Give reasonable error messages for illegal inputs
3. Need not worry abouit misbehaving hardware
4. Need not worry about misbehaving system software
5. Our program is allowed to terminate after finding an error. 

Sources of errors: 
*â€¯Poor specification of the problem
* Incomplete programs: debug and test during development!
* Unexpedted arguments
* Unexpedted input

Kinds of errors: 
* PPP 5.3: compile-time errors
* PPP 5.4 and 8.2-8.3: Link-time errors
* Run time errors
* Logic errors

Example program: drill.cpp!

Vector out of range error --> exception.cpp
try - catch

Pre- and post-condition PPP 5.10

Bruk error()! --> The recommended way to report an error is to throw an exception

# Struct and class PPP 9

Class and struct are similar, but not the same. 

Capital letter used normally in class-names. 

Difference between struct and class: 
* Class members are PRIVATE BY DEFAULT
* Struct members are PUBLIC BY DEFAULT
