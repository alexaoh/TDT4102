# Questions to the tasks (SOLVED)
1. Unsure if recursion is the optimal way to solve openTile()-function! 

> Yes, this works just fine! LF solved the problem exactly the same way also. 

2. Check how they solved quit() and restart() buttons in LF:

> quit() uses hide, the same way I solved it. I just made a new object in my restart() which is a better solution IMO, compared to LF, where they reset the variables and set new mines manually.
