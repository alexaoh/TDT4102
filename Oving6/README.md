# Questions to the tasks

1. Q about the constructor of CourseCatalog: Should i define one for it? Or should it just use a default constructor when I don't want to pass arguments when initializing an object of the class?

2. How to readFromFile in to CourseCatalog? Does not work :(

3. Which header-files am I actually using when graphing in task 5? Not too clearly stated in the book, can't find it there :(
