# Questions to the tasks

1. Any other way to add all the keys from the enumerators in the enumerations Suit and Rank? Very time consuming to manually define all the keys in the map, when they already are defined in the enummartions Rank and Suit. This also makes it easy to forget some om the enumerators (Task 1d). 

2. Are classes/enums/structs etc usually declared and defined in the header files? Or declared in header files and defined i cpp files? 
> Seems like the second option is the most used: The class with all datatypes etc are declared in header files, but all the functionality is defined in cpp files (getters and setters). 

3. Check LF for solution of the member functions of Card. I wonder how they have solved the problem differently!

4. vector.erase() apparently does not work with a regular index? It worked with vector.end()-1, to give the last index. Iterator? What exactly is that? Why does it not work as I expected?
